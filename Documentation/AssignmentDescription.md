# Project Description

 This application will be a user-focused weather platform offering real-time weather updates and a 5-day forecast for selected locations. The platform will allow users to create accounts, allowing them to access, personalize, and share their dashboards with other users. The system will support search functionality, enabling users to retrieve weather details by city name. For each selected location, it will display current temperature, weather conditions, and an appropriate weather icon, with user-selectable display formats for personalization. Users will also benefit from quick access to saved favorite locations on their dashboards and can share this information with others once they have created an account. In addition, the application will maintain a simple and intuitive interface, ensuring accessibility across multiple web screen sizes and browser environments like Chrome and Safari. It will adhere to data privacy standards, disclosing only necessary user information. Users can expect seamless login and logout functionality to protect their accounts. The platform will also notify users of any errors in retrieving weather data, managing accounts, or sharing features, making the experience smooth and user-friendly.

1. Users must be able to create, edit, and delete accounts.
2. Users will be able to log in to access their personal dashboard.
3. Users can personalize their dashboard (e.g., select favorite locations or adjust themes).
4. Logged-in users will be able to save favorite locations for quick access on the dashboard.
5. Logged-in users will be able to share their dashboard with other users.
6. The system will allow users to search for weather information by city name.
7. The system will display current weather for the selected location, including temperature, weather conditions (e.g., cloudy, rainy), and an icon representing the current weather condition.
8. The system will display a 5-day weather forecast, showing daily temperatures, weather conditions.
9. Users will be able to choose how to display temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit) and weather formats (e.g., detailed/summary view).
10. Shared dashboards will be view-only for other users.
11. he system will notify the user of any errors in retrieving weather, account management, or sharing, if they occur.


**Non-functional Requirements**

1. The user interface should be simple and intuitive, allowing users to quickly access weather information.
2. The system will support multiple active users simultaneously. 
3. The system must not disclose any personal information about users apart from their name and shared dashboards to users of the system.
4. The app must work on common browsers like Chrome and Safari.
5. Basic login and logout functionality should be implemented to protect accounts.
6. The application must adapt to various screen sizes (web), so that it displays content properly depending on how large the browser screen size is.

  
## Project Goals:

* To deepen the students' understanding of software engineering principles, tools, and techniques.
* To enable students to apply software engineering principles, tools, and techniques to the development of complex software systems.
* To introduce students to agile development methodologies, software metrics, and software quality assurance.
* To foster collaboration and teamwork among students in the development of software systems.

The goal is to be able to build good code quickly (using the proper processes).  Remember: **Perfect is the enemy of good**

Build incrementally with this in mind, making small and incremental improvements.

## The Projects (all are web apps):

**Your team MUST select one of the these projects.**  Please take the time to review the details for each.

**Todo App:**  Develop a basic to-do list app that allows users to manage tasks. Users can add, edit, delete tasks, and organize them by categories or due dates.  Users will also be able to share (view/edit) with other users.  The system needs to allow tasks to be organized into custom categories (e.g., Work, Personal) as well as support optional due dates with simple reminders or alerts.  Users will be able to ssign priority to tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low) as well as view tasks based on categories, priorities, or due dates.  The platform should incorporate the Command Pattern to implement undo and redo functionalities for task actions, the Observer Pattern to update task lists dynamically when changes occur and the Strategy Pattern for sorting algorithms based on different criteria. Additionally, the platform should incorporate Continuous Integration (CI) and automated testing.

**Flashcard Study App:**  Create a simple flashcard application that allows users to create, edit, and review flashcards for studying. The app supports text-based cards and simple categorization into decks.  With the online system,  users will be able to create and organize flashcards into decks by subject or topic.  They will be able to create flashcards but adding questions and answers to flashcards.   The system will have a study mode that will allow flashcards to be reviewed in order or in a randomized fashion.   The system will also allow for progress tracking, allowing users to  mark flashcards as known or unknown so progress can be tracked.  Users will also allow their flashcards to be shared with other users or publicly as well as having the ability to share decks with others via simple file formats.  The platform should incorporate the Factory Pattern for creating different types of flashcards or decks, the Iterator Pattern to  navigate through flashcards efficiently and the Singleton Pattern to manage user settings or session data.  Additionally, the platform should incorporate Continuous Integration (CI) and automated testing.

**Weather Forecast Application:** Build a simple application that displays current weather information and a 5-day forecast for a user-selected location using a public weather API.  Users will need to create an account so they can access and edit  their dashboard as well as being able to share it with other users.  The system must support location search where users can search for weather information by city name as well as display the current weather showing temperature, weather conditions, and an icon representing the weather (with the user being able to select formats/options for how data is displayed).  The system will also show a 5-day forecast which will display basic forecast information for the next five days.  Users will also be able to save favourite locations for quick access on their dashboard as well as being able to save and share with other users.   The platform should incorporate the Adapter Pattern to interface with the external weather API. the Singleton Pattern to  manage a single instance of the API client and the Facade Pattern to simplify the interface for fetching and displaying weather data.   Additionally, the platform should incorporate Continuous Integration (CI) and automated testing.

**Discord Clone:** This project involves the development of a web-based platform for online communication and collaboration, similar to the popular chat app, Discord. The platform should incorporate the Observer design pattern to notify users of new messages, and the Mediator design pattern to manage communication between users and channels. The platform should also implement the Singleton design pattern to ensure that only one instance of the chat server is running at any given time, and the Command design pattern to enable users to execute commands (e.g. change username, join channel). Additionally, the platform should incorporate Continuous Integration (CI) and automated testing.

## Statement on the Use of GitHub Copilot and Generative AI Tools

Students are permitted and encouraged to utilize AI-powered tools such as GitHub Copilot and other generative AI assistants for coding, user interface (UI), and user experience (UX) design aspects of their projects. These tools can serve as valuable resources to enhance productivity, inspire creativity, and assist in overcoming technical challenges.  The focus of the project is to develop and improve skills surrounding the process of developing software BUT the team must observe the process and work in an iterative fashion using TDD.
