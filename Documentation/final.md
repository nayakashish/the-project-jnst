# Milestone #7 - Final Delivery

## Video Walkthrough 
```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4uOsS0FsEs```

For your final deliverable, you will need to produce a short video overview of your product walking through the features implemented (review what you committed to and ensure that you demo them).  This should be no more than 5-10 minutes.  For this, you only have to deploy the system on your local machine for this demo.   You can also choose to discuss the architecture of your system, the different components as well as how the system is built and deployed. 

## Summary Report:


### General Development:

 - What did your team build?
 - Is it feature complete and running?  Clearly address each feature and it's state,
 - How many of your initial requirements that your team set out to deliver did you actually deliver (a checklist/table would help to summarize)?  Were you able to deliver everything or are there things missing?  Did your initial requirements sufficiently capture the details needed for the project?
 - What is the architecture of the system?
 - What are the key components?
 - What design patterns did you use in the implementation?  
 - What degree and level of re-use was the team able to achieve and why?
 - How many tasks are left in the backlog?

#### CI/CD:

 - What testing strategies did you implement? Comment on their degree of automation and the tools used.
 - Would you (as a team) deal with testing differently in the future?  **Make sure to ensure that your testing report is updated to reflect what's actually been done.** 
 - How did your branching workflow work for the team? Were you successful in properly reviewing the code before merging as a team?
 - How would your project be deployed? Is it docker ready and tested? Provide a brief description of the level of dockerization you have implemented and what would be required to deploy.

## Reflections:
**[REMOVE THE LIST BEFORE SUBMISSION, the following is the list of question for us to answer in our paragraph response]**
 - How did your project management work for the team? 
What was the hardest thing and what would you do the same/differently the next time you plan to complete a project like this? 
 - Do you feel that your initial requirements were sufficiently detailed for this project?  Which requirements did you miss or overlook?
 - What did you miss in your initial planning for the project (beyond just the requirements)?
 - What process did you use (ie Scrum, Kanabn..), how was it managed, and what was observed? 
 - As a team, did you encounter issues with different team members developing with different IDEs?  In the future, would the team change anything in regard to the uniformity of development environments?
 - If you were to estimate the efforts required for this project again, what would you consider?  (Really I am asking the team to reflect on the difference between what you thought it would take to complete the project vs what it actually took to deliver it).   
 - What did your team do that you feel is unique or something that the team is especially proud of (was there a big learning moment that the team had in terms of gaining knowledge of a new concept/process that was implemented).
 - How did AI impact the development of the project?
