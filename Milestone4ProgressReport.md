## **3. Comments on Process**

- **Whatâ€™s Working:**
  - Kanban board keeps tasks visible and manageable.

## **5. Reflection**

Collectively we believe that we had chalenges in terms of communicating with eachother during the break. We plan to create a system that will enable us to deliver what we need to get done to each other, and ensuring that we are detailed with the tasks we are doing, and how we will be doing it. We also need to create concrete deadlines on when tasks should be finished; we essentially just tried to get as much done as possible, and move to the next task when finished, for this milestone. Creating hard deadlines per task might improve overall group productivity. Task selection and order should also be discussed when we meet in person.
