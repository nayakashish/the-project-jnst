## **3. Comments on Process**

- **Whatâ€™s Working:**
  - Kanban board keeps tasks visible and manageable.
  - Iterative work on the project everyday.
  - Communication has been going well between team members since return from reading break. Involving daily check-ins and updates occuring in our project chat. 
  - The proposed scrum-like workflow has been working well and progress has been consistent as well as communication between members.
  - Rotate on roles so everyone understands each part of the project.
  - Following detailed PR template to describe PRs
  - Marking unfinished tasks as issues to priortize them.

- **Challenges:**
  - Communication gaps between integrating certain parts.
  - Keeping up with the PRs including reviewing and merging was initially a challenge, but the team quickly found a rhythm in this area. 
  - Initially the team was not creating issues for the PRs and features-list, however this was caught and the team began creating issues, adding them to PRs and closing them when completed in the kanbam board. 


- **Proposed Changes:**
  - Informal meetings to discuss where we are at, what questions need to be answered and what's next as we move forward.
  - Conduct retrospectives after each milestone to identify areas of improvement and celebrate successes.
  - Each member keeps track of open PRs and reviews when they are able.

## **5. Reflection**
One of the main challenges we faced was integrating the various components of our application, particularly ensuring that the Flask application could correctly serve static files. We also encountered difficulties with setting up the Docker environment, which required several tries to get right. The frontend has undergone several iterations, however it has been receiving steady development and is reaching our desired state. We believe that we have made good progress during the last milestone and are on track to completing the project.

## **6. Testing Report**

- Create basic testing framework (including CI) is completed
- Failing tests during development of each new feature have been created before implementing functionality. Then after impleneting the feature, along with passing it's own tests, previous tests are expected to pass as well. This has been a requirement for our team as we develop and if the test doesn't psas, the team member resolves the issue before the feature is merged into dev.
- Test Plan spreadsheet has been updated as features have been added. (Seen on team member's UBC sharepoint, populated test plan will be added to repo on completion of project)
