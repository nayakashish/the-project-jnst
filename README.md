## **3. Comments on Process**

- **Whatâ€™s Working:**
  - Kanban board keeps tasks visible and manageable.
  - Iterative work on the project everyday.
  - Communication has been going well between team members since return from reading break. Almost daily check-ins and updates occuring in our project chat. 
  - The proposed scrum-like workflow has been working well and progress has been consistent as well as communication between members.

- **Challenges:**
  - Communication gaps between integrating certain parts.
    - Shared understanding of the components of the project. Each member, knows well their own section, but not so much how other sections will communicate. 

- **Proposed Changes:**
  - Rotate on roles so everyone understands each part of the project.
  - Informal meetings to discuss where we are at, what questions need to be answered and what's next as we move forward.

## **5. Reflection**
One of the main challenges we faced was integrating the various components of our application, particularly ensuring that the Flask application could correctly serve static files. We also encountered difficulties with setting up the Docker environment, which required several tries to get right. The frontend has undergone several iterations, however it has been receiving steady development and is reaching our desired state. We believe that we have made good progress during the last milestone and are on track to completing the project.
